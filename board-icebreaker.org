ICEbreaker FPGA board https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker
* board
- Blue LED for status CDONE (Configuration DONE) - stays lit after succeeding
- !? "Test points for UART Rx / Tx signals", where?
** !! failure mode reset
- no physical RESET button (?)  https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker/issues/48
- CRESET jumper: "I didn't have it soldered so I just shorted it with
  some tweezers"  https://canary.discord.com/channels/613131135903596547/613133241683279873/1049972192949043200
- "hold down the RESET button and plug it in does it enumerate?"  https://canary.discord.com/channels/613131135903596547/613133241683279873/1049971682925875200

* USB
- enumerate :: USB device gets recognized by Linux and is assgined a device file (?)
- "The icebreaker has a serial link to the host PC through the FTDI.
  The FTDI has two ports, one is used for programming and the second
  one is configured as uart and conencted to two FPGA pins where you
  can communicate with it from your fpga design which is exactly what
  the example you pointed to does."  https://canary.discord.com/channels/613131135903596547/613133241683279873/1049776083433693204
- "Baudrate is what you make it. It's just connected to two FPGA IOs."  https://canary.discord.com/channels/613131135903596547/613133241683279873/1063408105406332928
- "first [interface] appears as a UART on boot because that's what the FTDI
  defaults to, but it's *wired as SPI* and iceprog will reconfigure it
  at runtime as needed."
- ttyUSB1 (2nd interface, usually): "FTDI chip on the board used to
  reconfigure the FPGA and provide a *serial* to USB connection on
  gateware that chooses to make use of it"
