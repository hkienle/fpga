- FPGA chips
  - all proprietary
  - major players: Xilinx (AMD) and Intel (formerly Altera)
  - minor players
    - Lattice
      - "After AMD completed the acquisition of Xilinx in February
        2022, Lattice Semiconductor became the last fully independent
        major manufacturer of FPGAs."  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Semiconductor#Operations

- architecture
  https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-fpga-and-its-architecture-20a62c14421c
  - logic blocks :: "implement the logical functions required by the
    design and consist of various components such as transistor pairs,
    *look-up tables* (LUTs), flip flops, and multiplexers"
  - programmable interconnect :: "hook [logic blocks] together by
    programming the interconnects"
- memory types  https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-memory-types/
  - flips-flops :: 1-bit state/register (number of flip-flop is always the same as number of LUTs?)
  - DRAM :: distributed RAM is built with LUTs (not supported by all FPGAs)
    - high latency for random access (sequential works well)
    - "complex to interface with: you’re almost certainly going to
      have to use vendor IP blocks and a cache to make DRAM usable"
  - BRAM :: block RAM
  - SRAM :: static RAM, high speed but costly (not supported by all FPGAs, but iCE40 UP has it)
- IP blocks
  - FOSS collection of IP blocks  https://opencores.org/
  - soft macro/block :: "A soft macro is the RTL [sic: HDL?] (VHDL or
    Verilog) that describes the functional implementation of the
    IP. This is compiled into a gate-level netlist, which is then
    turned into a physical layout to produce the mask set for
    manufacturing."  https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/226841/305687
  - hard macro/block ::  "A hard macro is a physical layout of the IP
    suitable for a given process. It's added to the larger chip layout
    as a single block, which saves some steps in the design process."
- bitstream format
  - not disclosed by manufacturer
    - allows closed/expensive IP blocks (?)
    - manufacturer can charge for its tools
    - reverse engineering with fuzzing
  - "The details of a specific FPGA's bitstream format (which defines
    how the internal elements of the FPGA are connected and interact
    with each other) are not usually published by FPGA vendors. This
    means that, generally, an engineer creating a design for an FPGA
    must use the tools provided by the FPGA's manufacturer."  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICE_(FPGA)#Development]]
  - many reverse engineering efforts
    - Lattice ECP5  https://prjtrellis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
    - Lattice iCE
    - Anlogic  https://github.com/mmicko/prjtang
  - bitstream compression/compaction is desirable  https://github.com/nmi-leipzig/compact_bitstream

- ...40 derives from 40 nm process
- on the market since 2016 (HX is older)
- best FOSS support (?)
  - IceStorm has "support for iCE40 UltraPlus devices"  http://bygone.clairexen.net/icestorm/
  - Yosys tooling for iCE40 "enables a level of transparency and
    reproducibility that make iCE40 FPGAs highly suited for scientific
    research"  https://www.easychair.org/publications/preprint/TPpq
